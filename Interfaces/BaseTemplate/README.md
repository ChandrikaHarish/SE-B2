# Where to place your content?

- Make the folder for your interface. Copy the contents of this folder into your new folder. Then do the following. 

- Further instructions are mentioned in `index.html` only.

- In `index.html` you'll find a comment `<!-- START EDITING FROM HERE -->`.

- Below that comment is a `<div>` with `id="customContent"`. Place your `divs`  in that div only.

- For CSS, see the `css` folder, find the `style.css` folder and place you CSS in between the comments only.

- For JS, see the `<script>` tag and place you JS in between the comments only.

- Don't disturb any code which is not marked for editing. Any issues, mark as an "issue" in the repo and ask the doubt.
